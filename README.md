# Delaunaytriangulation
An implementation of Delaunay triangulation using divide and conquer algorithm
## Algorithm
A divide and conquer algorithm is implemented to break down a set of points to subsets. Triangulation is performed to merge each 2 subsets to form larger and more complex triangulations. The whole implementation takes O(n^2log(n)) times.
## Mathematical method of merging triangulations
The mathematical method of merging triangulations can be found [here](http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~samuelp/del_project.html)
